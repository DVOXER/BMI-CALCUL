# My BMI Calculator App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my BMI Calculator project. I built this app to help people track their BMI (Body Mass Index) in a simple and intuitive way. It's my first serious Flutter project with Firebase integration, and I'm pretty excited to share it.

## What's This App About?

I created this BMI calculator to solve a common problem: making health tracking accessible and straightforward. My app lets you:

- Calculate your BMI with just your height and weight
- See where you stand with a cool animated gauge
- Track your BMI history over time
- Use the app in English, Arabic, or French (I wanted to make it accessible!)

## Tech I Used

- **Flutter** for building the cross-platform UI
- **Firebase** for authentication and storing user data
- **Shared Preferences** for saving user settings like language preference
- Custom localization system I built from scratch

## Features I'm Proud Of

### User-Friendly Authentication
I implemented a complete login/registration system with Firebase. The app remembers who you are so you don't need to log in every time.

### Smooth BMI Calculation
Just enter your weight and height, and the app calculates your BMI instantly. I added an animated gauge to visually show where your BMI falls on the scale.

### Multi-Language Support
I added support for English, Arabic and French. The app even handles right-to-left text direction for Arabic automatically!

### History Tracking
Every BMI calculation is saved to your personal history, so you can track changes over time.

## How to Run My Project

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
3. Make sure you have Firebase configured (see Firebase setup section below)
4. Run the app with `flutter run`

## Firebase Setup

You'll need to:
1. Create a Firebase project
2. Enable Authentication with Email/Password
3. Set up Cloud Firestore
4. Update the Firebase config file with your credentials

## Project Structure

I organized my code like this:
```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart                  # App entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ auth_screens.dart          # Login and registration screens
â”œâ”€â”€ bmi_calculator.dart        # The main BMI calculator functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ firebase_config.dart       # Firebase setup
â”œâ”€â”€ language_selection.dart    # Language picker
â”œâ”€â”€ localization_service.dart  # My custom localization service
â””â”€â”€ translations/              # Language files
    â”œâ”€â”€ en.dart
    â”œâ”€â”€ ar.dart
    â””â”€â”€ fr.dart
```

## Future Plans

I'm planning to add:
- Weight/BMI trend graphs
- Option to switch between metric and imperial units
- More languages
- Cloud sync across devices
- Dark mode
